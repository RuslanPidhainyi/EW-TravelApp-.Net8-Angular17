## 0. Intro üëÅÔ∏èüëÅÔ∏è

TravelApp is a social network for travelers that allows users to share their travel experiences in the form of posts. The main idea of the project is to create a platform where one can find unique locations, obtain useful information about routes, expenses, and services, as well as communicate with other travelers.

Users can:

- Publish posts with photographs of unique places, information about the country, region, and route details.
- Add data about expenses (transportation, accommodation, entrance fees, guide services, etc.).
- Communicate with each other through the messaging system to clarify details or receive personalized advice.
- Plan trips using reliable and structured information from posts.

The platform simplifies the travel planning process and saves time by providing the opportunity to share real experiences and build a community of like-minded individuals.


<a name="problems"></a>
## 1. For what purpose was TravelApp created and what problems does it solve? üî≠

- The lack of a specialized platform for sharing unique experiences:

Travelers who visit little-known and rare places had limited opportunities to share their experiences with an interested audience. 
Traditional social networks do not always provide the necessary structure for a detailed description of the specifics of a journey.


- Lack of reliable information on safety and logistics:

The need for travelers to obtain up-to-date data on road conditions, regional safety, accommodation options, transportation,
and other details‚Äîespecially during times of war or pandemics‚Äîremained unmet.

- Difficulty in finding like-minded individuals and organizing joint excursions:

Travelers found it challenging to locate kindred spirits, discuss routes, receive advice, and even organize group trips.
This created barriers for beginners or those traveling to unfamiliar places.

- The absence of a centralized source for travel planning:

Gathering information about places, routes, expenses, and services (such as guides, transport, accommodation) from various sources took a lot of time and resources, and could also contain inaccuracies. Searching for specific information required significant effort and often led to situations where the data was fragmented or incomplete.

TravelApp solves this problem by providing a centralized platform where all the necessary experience and information are collected in one place ‚Äì in a single user post. Such a post presents a lot of clear and structured information:

Route details ‚Äì from path descriptions to advice on optimal routes.
Photographs ‚Äì visual confirmation of the uniqueness of the place.
Expenses and logistics ‚Äì information about local transport, price ranges, travel time, as well as fees for entry, accommodation, the availability of shops, and guide services.
Moreover, if necessary, the user can directly contact the post's author through the TravelApp messaging system to ask additional questions or clarify travel details. This enables users to receive personalized advice from someone who has already visited the place, significantly saving time and effort when planning their next trip.

All liked posts are saved on the Lists page. 

In this video, I demonstrate how to unlike a post. When you remove a like, the post is not immediately removed from the saved list. This means that the post will remain in the list until you refresh the page, even if you no longer like it. Thus, you can continue interacting with the post until the page is updated.

<a name="message"></a>

   - Use the "Message" tab located in the center to open the chat.
   - Or click the "Send a message" button, after which you will be taken directly to the chat and can begin communicating.
An example of this process is shown in the video.

## 4 Application security üîí
In the project, I decided to use various mechanisms and technologies to enhance the application's security. Below, I list the technologies I have chosen to use.
   - HTTPS
   - Token JWT
   - CORS
   - ASP .Net Core Identity
   - Form validation
   
<a name="impl"></a>
## 5 Instructions for installing the application locally ‚òïÔ∏è:
1. To run the application locally, you first need to clone the repository from GitHub using the link below.
   https://github.com/RuslanPidhainyi/EW-TravelApp-.Net8-Angular17
   
2. To start the ASP.NET Core server, you need to install the .NET 8 SDK packages, which can be found at the link below.

   https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/8.0
   
3. To add the application's HTTPS certificate to the system's trusted certificates list, navigate to the API directory in the terminal and execute the following commands:
   - ‚Äû dotnet dev-certs https --clean ‚Äù
   - ‚Äú dotnet dev-certs https --trust ‚Äù
   
4. To run the application correctly, you need to apply migrations. This can be done using the Entity Framework Core Command-line Tools, which can be installed with the following command in the terminal.
   - ‚Äû dotnet tool install --global dotnet-ef ‚Äù
     
5. Installing Node.js is required to use the npm tool.
   https://nodejs.org/en/download
   
6. Once the npm tool is available, you need to install Angular using the following command:
   - ‚Äû npm install -g @angular/cli ‚Äù
     
In case of errors, you can try executing the following command to resolve them:
   - ‚Äû Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope Process -ExecutionPolicy Bypass ‚Äù
     
And try again:
   - ‚Äû npm install ‚Äù

7. The next step will be to add the SSL certificate. In the command prompt (opened as administrator), navigate to the frontend directory of the application and execute the commands listed below:
   - ‚Äû choco intsall mkcert ‚Äù 
   - ‚Äû mkdir ssl ‚Äù 
   - ‚Äû cd ssl ‚Äù 
   - ‚Äû mkcert localhost ‚Äù
   
   Example of correctly executed SSL certificate addition commands:

   ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0d805e96-5820-4ef3-8b8a-970e18ea975f)

8. While in the command prompt, you should also install mkcert with the following command:
   - ‚Äû mkcert -install ‚Äù

After successfully completing the installation, restart the computer.

9. To configure the MSSQL database, you need to specify the name of the local server in the 'appsettings.Development.json' file. Below is a screenshot showing an example of the modified server name.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d7e9dc47-514b-4afa-a5fc-7ebfc0627f6c)

10. Cloudinary 
   TODO

11. You can create a migration by executing the following command:
    - ‚Äû dotnet ef migrations add InitialCreate --output-dir Data/Migrations ‚Äù
    
    However, it is only the command " dotnet ef database update " that will create the database. Below is a screenshot showing an example of the newly created database.

    ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e2f923dd-5930-43b4-adc2-74649c54aaf4)

12. After completing the previous steps, the application is ready to be launched.
- On the backend: " dotnet run "
- On the frontend: " ng serve "

Below are screenshots showing the launch of the frontend and backend servers.

  ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1bce86f1-09b6-4dc7-9112-df65eeff6382)
  
  ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4702294a-3631-4528-8c03-c0e0a3d96599)
  
  After starting the servers, you need to go to the URL in the browser window

13. After starting the servers, you need to go to the URL https://localhost:4200/ in the browser window, and the application will be launched
